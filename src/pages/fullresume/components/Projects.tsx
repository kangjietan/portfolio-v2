  "A MERN stack web application where you can have a restaurant randomly chosen for you based on your inputs for the term and location or browse for restaurants to add to a custom or favorites list that you can randomize from. The custom list is just for people who want to make a quick list of restaurants to be randomized. To save your favorites list, you need to be registered. Data about the businesses comes from the backend, where the server acts as a proxy that sends requests to the Yelp Fusion API.",
  "A MERN stack application to browse movies and manage your list of movies that you will watch or ones that youâ€™ve watched already. Data about the movies comes from the backend, where the server acts as a proxy that sends requests to the TMDB API.",
  "A full-stack application where you can have a restaurant randomly chosen for you based on your inputs for the term and location. There is a selection of food/dish images you can click on to search the Yelp Fusion API.",
  "A group project where we took over another group's project Frontend Capstone and scaled the backend to handle production-level traffic. The goal was to scale up to 10k RPS in a 2-week time frame from choosing the database to seeding to testing to scaling. The process only involved horizontally scaling and no vertically scaling. Horizontally scaling was done with the AWS EC2 free tier instance (t2 micro).",
